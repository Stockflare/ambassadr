# Publishes and maintains micro-service endpoints to etcd.
#
# This gem is designed to be used inside a Docker container, running alongside
# Etcd. Typical of a CoreOS environment.
#
# It is capable of "wrapping" any executable within a forked process and publishing
# any described endpoints to Etcd, using the Docker Daemon API. The best use case
# for this is running an API inside the gem, such like
#   `$ docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
#    -d my-company/api ambassador rackup -etcd localhost:4001 \
#    -docker unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
#
# Ambassador makes use of the LABEL definition within the Dockerfile
